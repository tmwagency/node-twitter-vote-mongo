Twitter Live Streaming Poll
===========================

A demo to hook up Node.js and Socket.io with Twitter's streaming API to read in a live stream of tweets (based on a track filter if you wish to use one) which you can then do whatever you want with!

Thanks to:

**thedillonb** - Great article on [setting up node and twitter streaming](http://www.dillonbuchanan.com/programming/node-js-twitter-streaming-api-socket-io-twitter-cashtag-heatmap/) and [source code from that article](https://github.com/thedillonb/twitter-cashtag-heatmap).  These source files were used as the start point for this project.


Demo
=======================

Coming soon...
